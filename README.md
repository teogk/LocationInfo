# LocationInfo

Description: A web App that

• calls a service and displays the results it returns

• passes the language of the browser in order to retrieve translated results

• introduce a blank period timeout during which no calls to the location service will be performed
    while the user keystrokes happen faster than that timeout to prevent wasteful of the server resources
  
• caches the results of the location service 

• be responsive and cater for views from tablets and mobiles
